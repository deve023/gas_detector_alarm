# Gas Detector Alarm

The system has a gas detector. When gas is detected a yellow LED turns on and an alarm buzzer rings. When gas is no longer present, the LED turns off but the sound alarm remains until the user presses the deactivation button. Cost: aproximately USD 16 if one purchases the components through Amazon.

The repository contains the VHD code describing the hardware, a test bench to try out the different scenarios and the circuit diagram. 3D design of the case is pending.
